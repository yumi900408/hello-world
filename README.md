Hello everyone!

My name is 曾亭瑄. You can call me Yumi.
I like to play mobile games, especially one called "Punishing: Gray Raven". I have been playing the  game for ten months.
 I love it so much that I volunteered to be a moderator of this game’s official Facebook group.
People of the game’s group are very nice. 
Even though my major is taxing, I don't think it gives me too much pressure.
I will keep on serving this group as long as I like the game.
This picture was taken in the game’s themed restaurant.
I made a lot of friends through the game. 
One of them is from China .Although we have different views, we still get along with each other well. Sometimes, when I have some english’s question, I will ask him because my English is pretty basic compared to his English.
